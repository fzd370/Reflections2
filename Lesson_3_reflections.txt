Question 1 :-
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer :-
I would like to use a remote repository when I'm working on a project with a group of peolpe like some open source projects. In this way
I will be able to share my progress with my team mates and also see there progress.

Question 2 :-
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than Git automatically
stay-up-to-date with your remote repository ?

Answer :-
I would like to manually pull changes because I would want 
only the correct changes to become part of my local repository. 
If all the changes were pulled automatically then it would become very hard to
manage the project.
